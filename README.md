# A-New-Era-of-Data-Analysis-in-Baseball

In this project, I compared the home runs of two of baseball's biggest stars, Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton, both of whom currently play for the New York Yankees. To do this, I used Statcast data from 2015-2017, which was collected using high-resolution cameras and radar equipment. I used Python and pandas to wrangle, analyze, and visualize the data, and utilized matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization. Overall, this project gave me a better understanding of Statcast data and its use in data analysis.

• Conducted a data analysis comparing the home run hitting styles of two MLB sluggers, Giancarlo Stanton and Aaron Judge.


• Utilized Statcast data to measure the launch angle, exit velocity, pitch velocity, and pitch location of the two players' home runs.


• Found that Judge hits his home runs off of faster pitches than Stanton, and that Judge's home run zone is spread out while Stanton's is focused in the middle-inside of the strike zone.


• Concluded that Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton are not identical despite their superficial similarities, and that opposing pitchers should still be scared.
